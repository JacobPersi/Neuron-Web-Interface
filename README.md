# Neuron Visualization Frontend
This project is a web-based front-end visualization layer for the Neuron simulation engine developed by Yale University. It is built using Vue.js, Babylon.js, Tailwind CSS, and Python, and communicates with the simulation engine via WebSocket.

Please note that this project was developed in a few weeks for a school assignment and is still a work in progress. As such, it resembles a prototype more than a finished product. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome and appreciated.
